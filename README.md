# MFARB: A Benchmark for Masked Face Attribute Recognition
This is a face attribute recognition dataset with mask robustness. And it is divided into two parts, the first part is generated by performing mask synthesis on the existing attribute recognition datasets CelebA(41 attributes, 199,899 images) and MAAD-Face(48 attributes, 3,093,309 images). The second part is constructed by manually labeling the existing masked face dataset(54 attributes, 11,245 images). In addition to the dataset proposed above, our dataset also includes the original CelebA and MAAD-Face, so our dataset includes faces with and without masks. And it will be published soon...
